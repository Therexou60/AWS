# Creating a Basic Amazon S3 Lifecycle Policy with Glacier

## Introduction

AWS Glacier is a long-term archive 
storage service that provides lower-cost storage than other AWS storage 
options. When data has not been accessed for a certain period of time, 
it can be moved automatically between S3 storage classes using a 
lifecycle policy. In this lab, we will create a basic Amazon S3 
lifecycle policy.

## Solution

Log in to the AWS Management Console using the credentials provided on the lab instructions page. Make sure you're using the `us-east-1` region.

[Download the ccp-master folder](https://github.com/tia-la/ccp) to upload to the S3 bucket we create.

### Create an S3 Bucket and Upload an Object

1. Navigate to S3.
2. Click **Create bucket**.
3. In *Bucket name*, enter a globally unique name.
4. Deselect *Block all public access*.
5. Click **I acknowledge that the current settings might result in the bucket and the objects within becoming public**.
6. Click **Create bucket**.
7. Click the bucket to open it and click **Upload**.
8. Click **Add folder**.
9. Select the `ccp-master` folder downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/tia-la/ccp).
10. Click **Upload** > **Upload**.
11. At the bottom of the page, click **Upload**.

### Create a Lifecycle Policy

1. Return to the main page of the S3 bucket.
2. Select the **Management** tab.
3. Scroll to *Lifecycle rules* and click **Create lifecycle rule**.
4. In *Lifecycle rule name*, enter "s3-to-glacier-flexible-retrieval-rule".
5. Scroll to *Filter type* and in *Prefix* enter "pinehead".
6. In *Lifecycle rule actions*, click **Move current versions of objects between storage classes** and **Move noncurrent versions of objects between storage classes**.
7. In *Move current versions of objects between storage classes*, select **Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly Amazon Glacier)** from the dropdown and set *Days after object creation* to "30".
8. Click **I acknowledge that this lifecycle rule will increase the one-time lifecycle request cost if it transitions small objects.**
9. In *Move noncurrent versions of objects between storage classes*, select **Glacier Deep Archive** from the dropdown and set *Days after objects become noncurrent* to "15".
10. Click **I acknowledge that this lifecycle rule will increase the one-time lifecycle request cost if it transitions small objects.**
11. Click **Create rule**.
