# Monitoring, Auditing, and Logging Users and Resource Usage in AWS IAM

## Introduction

In this hands-on lab scenario, you are
 a security engineer working for a new startup that's launching an 
online bookstore for rare and antique books. The founder, Kia, needs 
your help with monitoring and auditing the activities in her account. In
 order to provide access and ensure the proper security measures are in 
place, you will use AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM) and AWS 
CloudTrail. You will provide Kia with the credential report, the details
 from the Access Advisor tab, and you will create a trail using 
CloudTrail.

## Solution

Log in to the live AWS environment using the credentials provided. Make sure you're in the N. Virginia (`us-east-1`) region throughout the lab.

### Generate a Credential Report

1. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
2. From the left menu, click **Credential report**.
3. Click **Download Report** and open the downloaded CSV file. *(NOTE: This file can be viewed using Excel or Numbers.)*

> Note: The downloading and viewing of the CSV file is not a critical step. You can see example formatting of the CSV file at 00:50 in the solution video.
